# SEI-Project-1-Simon
## Overview

For project #1, I created a game of Simon.

When the page loads, the player is brought to game page. The game has a theme of the 1977 film 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and is thus called 'Simon Encounters'. I read that when Simon came out, it reminded consumers of the film.  First they can select what level of difficulty to play. The default level selected is 'Easy'. After the player selects the level of difficulty, they click 'Initiate Contact' to start the game. All the buttons activate (light up and sound) once to the speed of the level selected once to signal the game beginning. Then one button activates to start the pattern for the player to repeat back. The higher the level selected, the shorter the time of buttons activating in pattern order, and the longer the pattern length is to win. If the player makes an error, the game stops and the score is displayed at the bottom of the screen. If the player makes it to the pattern length of the selected level, they win and their score is displayed at the bottom of the screen. The pattern length limits by level are based on the original Simon game.
